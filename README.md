# Development Journey of Bustrex (Lesson Learned)

Creating Bustrex was an insightful and rewarding experience that significantly deepened my understanding of Flutter development, clean architecture, API integration, and user experience design. Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges and opportunities that helped me refine my skills and create a well-structured, scalable application.  

One of the most crucial lessons I learned was the importance of Clean Architecture. By structuring the project into presentation, core, and data layers, I was able to ensure that business logic remained independent of UI frameworks. This approach made the codebase more modular, scalable, and testable, reducing dependencies between components and making future updates easier to implement.  

Another significant aspect of the development process was theming and UI consistency. I explored Flutter's theming system. This not only enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the app but also improved usability and accessibility, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and user preferences.  

To further enhance the user experience, I implemented persistent data storage using SharedPreferences. This feature allowed the app to save user profile, even after the application was closed and reopened. Understanding how to manage local storage effectively was invaluable in ensuring a personalized and user-friendly experience.  

One of the most exciting yet challenging parts of the project was integrating an open-source API. Using The Movie Database (TMDB) API, I learned how to fetch real-time data, handle network requests, and properly manage API responses. This experience deepened my understanding of RESTful API integration and data processing, helping me ensure that the app provided accurate and up-to-date movie information.  

Overall, developing Bustrex was an enriching experience that strengthened my knowledge of software development best practices while allowing me to create a feature-rich, scalable, and engaging application.
